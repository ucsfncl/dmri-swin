# Diffusion MRI SWIN UNETR

In this repository, we present using SWIN transformers to do generalized diffusion MRI denoising and super-resolution. Our model is robust to:
- wide array of scanners (ge, siemens, etc.)
- different acquisition parameters (TE, TR, b-value, b-vector, etc.)
- diverse patient populations (adult patients with mTBI, children with neurodevelopmental disorders, children/adolescents with lesions, etc.)
